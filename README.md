# RecordPhysicsAsAnimations
 A Unity tool that lets you bake physics movements of an object and its children into animation and possibly let you save fps.
 
 If you are doing any sort of physics heavy effect such as shattering , exploding , 
 it can be a good idea to bake these effects into an animation and potentially gain fps by releasing the load from the physics engine.
 
 Unity package : https://github.com/guraysenova/RecordPhysicsAsAnimations/releases/download/v0.1/RecordPhysicsAsAnimations.unitypackage
 
 Currently the tool relies on user to not make any mistakes a lot and lacks a lot of features that can help the user experience.
 
 Users should be warned that you can easily make a mistake and forget the recorder on. So user caution is required.
